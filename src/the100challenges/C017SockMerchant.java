	 * Problem:		Dummy values are temporary changes in the given input. 
	 * 				There are certain problems, which involve inputs after visiting once, 
	 * 				it becomes redundant.These inputs if not changed will change 
	 * 				the after effect of the problem. In order to ensure that there are no changes 
	 * 				in the outcome due to these redundant variables. You have to know dummy values.
	 * 				Coming back to my question. Yes, Dummy values surely can and will expedite 
	 * 				the process of problem solving. The use of Dummy Values are elucidated with the following problem.
	 * 				John works at a clothing store. He has a large pile of socks that he must pair them by color for sale.
	 * 				You will be given an array of integers representing the color of each sock.
	 * 				Determine how many pairs of socks with matching colors there are.
	 * 				John works at a clothing store and heâ€™s going through a pile of socks to find 
	 * 				the number of matching pairs. More specifically, he has a pile of n loose socks 
	 * 				where each sock i is labeled with an integer,ci , denoting its color. 
	 * 				He wants to sell as many socks as possible, but his customers will only buy them in matching pairs.
	 * 				Two socks, i and j, are a single matching pair if they have the same color (ci==cj).
	 * 				Given n and the color of each sock, how many pairs of socks can John sell?
	 * Input:		Array n space-separated integers describing the colors ci of the socks in the pile.
	 * Output:		Print the total number of matching pairs of socks that John can sell.
